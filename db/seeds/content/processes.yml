      # Basic hacks

      **Congratulations!** If you are seeing this page it means that you've manage to get Docker up and running

      ## Before you start:

      Many of the exercises require 2 basic things:

      1. A proper text editor, there's many (free) options available. If unsure donwload Code:
         [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

      2. Access to a second terminal meanwhile the one with `docker-compose` is running. This will allow you to log into the emulated machine and access to the Rails console and the database.

      ## Howtos

      These are common operations required in the exercises. Use it as reference:

      #### Reload Rails

      Some changes that you make in the file system requires you to restart the server so Rails reloads the configuration from scratch. There's two ways to do that, either you use the CTRL+C to close `docker-compose` and the execute `docker-compose up` again or you just open another terminal and execute this order:

      ```bash
      docker-compose exec app bin/rails restart
      ```

      #### Access the Rails console

      In some exercises you will be asked to access the Rails console. This is a place where to interact with Decidim directly and, mostly, interact with the database.

      Open a new Terminal (while `docker-compose` is up) and navigate to the same folder where you have docker running.
      Then execute the order:

      ```bash
      docker-compose exec app bin/rails c
      ```

      You might have to prefix `sudo` in some systems.

      Once inside, as an example, you can try to access the organization object in the database, this is done with this command:

      ```ruby
      Decidim.Organization.first
      ```

      The result should look similar to this:
