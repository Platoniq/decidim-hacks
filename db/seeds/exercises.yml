  title:  Change the organization languages after creation
  body: >
      Once you've created an organization the [system admin](/system) admin does'nt let you change the languages.

      The main reason is because this operation is delicate as involve many entries in the database

      However, in a newly installed system it should'nt be a problem.

      To do that we will need:

      1. Edit the configured languages for this Decidim installation.
         Allowed languages can be found in https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/master/decidim-core/lib/decidim/core.rb#L135

      2. Log into the rails console to access the database.

      3. Find the organization you want to modify

      4. Add/remove languages

      5. Ensure the database is consistent after the modification.
